# Basic Programming

Hi there!  
I'm Indu Palacios — a psychologist passionate about technology, interactive design, and game development.  
This repository is a collection of my first steps into the world of programming. You'll find practical 
exercises and small projects developed mainly in **JavaScript** and **Python**.
